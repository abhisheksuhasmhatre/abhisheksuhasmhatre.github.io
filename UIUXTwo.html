                 <p class = "justify"> 
                    In today’s global world, more and more people are constantly finding ways to stay connected with
                    current events and with each other. Technology, especially in the mobile and networking world, is
                    constantly on the rise to help provide people with access to  information and resources, that would
                    help them stay connected, as well as increase the ease and efficiency at which they do things. Various
                    social media sites and applications such as Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, Snapchat, and lots more,
                    are being embedded in our daily lives in a ploy to provide fun and creative ways for us to communicate
                    in an instant, and maintain the flow of information. The grey area is that we are constantly being
                    bombarded by different notifications from messages, spam mails, phone calls and many more, which
                    can be distracting, especially when we are doing something important like studying, or in a meeting.
                    One physiological factor is that people are often tempted to pick up their mobile devices to check
                    for notifications or browse through various social media sites, even while they are doing something
                    important.
                    </br>
                    </br>
                    <b>Dependency is the preeminent problem</b>
                    </br>
                    </br>
                    Most people, especially the younger generation, cannot live a day without tweeting their thoughts,
                    or updating their Facebook status, or posting a picture on Instagram etc. Even when they don’t actively
                    participate in any live feed events, they still passively check for messages, and things posted by other
                    people. This building addiction, as some studies show, have had adverse effects on academic performance,
                    job performance, and even on safety, as a lot still focus on these social media platforms while driving.
                    This has lead our team to propose a design for an app called “The Slack-less app”, which will help you
                    isolate yourself from all of these distractions, especially while you are studying, driving, in a classroom
                    or in a meeting.
                </p>
                <div class="section-title">
                    <h2>Direction for solutions</h2> 
                </div>
                 <p class = "justify"> 
                    The proposed application will stem from the popular Pomodoro time-management technique, “which uses a
                    timer to break down task into 25 minutes intervals, separated by short breaks”. The application will extend
                    this technique by including a social media blocking feature.
                    </br>
                    </br>
                    The application will have two modes, the <b>“Study mode”</b>, which would be <b>25 minutes</b> long and the
                    <b>“Break mode”</b> which would be <b>5 minutes</b> long.
                    </br>
                    </br>
                    During <b>Study Mode</b>, all calls, text messages, social media apps and websites will be blocked temporarily.
                    All notifications would be stored in the app’s memory, and users will be given an option to select contacts
                    from their contact list, that would be allowed to contact them during the study time. If a particular phone
                    number that wasn’t selected tries to contact the user repeatedly (ideally more than 3 times), the app would
                    flag the number as an emergency and allow the call to go through.
                    </br>
                    </br>
                    During the <b>Break Mode</b>, all the functionalities will be restored and the user will be notified about
                    any stored notifications. After the 5 minutes break, the app would switch back to the study mode and continue
                    with the cycle. After four study modes, the break time will be increased to 15-20 minutes to give users
                    more time to rest. In addition, the users would be able to customize their own study time and break time,
                    with the only restriction being that the break time has to be at most half of the study time. Users will
                    also have the option of pre-setting the days and times they want the app to automatically go into study mode.

                    </br>
                    As an added feature, we intend to include a calendar schedule tracker, which would work in two ways.
                    First, it would ask the users to input their school’s user name and password (example:- xyz123.rit.edu),
                    it would then automatically synchronize with their class schedule (from RIT’s myCourses  or any other
                    school’s website) and remind them of deadlines, quiz times etc. It would be able to automatically put
                    the user’s phones on silent, within the hours of their class time. Secondly, users would be able to input
                    their schedules manually, and they would be reminded of their set deadlines accordingly.

                    <b>Objective of the App</b>
                    </br>
                    </br>
                    Our team is focused on assisting users to overcome distractions, and making most of the task automated,
                    so as not to burden the user with having to remember every task, and thus, provide the best user experience.
                    The user interface would be made simple to prevent confusion and cognitive burden, and it would also be
                    first use intuitive, for anyone to be able to easily use it. As a general rule, the privacy and security
                    of our users’ information would be of utmost concern, in order to keep users at ease while using the app.
                    The Purpose of our team is to develop a prototype that imparts the application’s highlighting features
                    through information gathering, knowledge mining, brainstorming, cross-referencing problems and solutions
                    and coming up with a convenient solution to every possible problem.

                    Each team member will be responsible for gathering information required to not only maintain security,
                    but also to gather the necessary information about our users. These will be used to tackle major problems,
                    which will arise overtime in the project development process. In order to ensure successful completion of
                    the project, each task will be split among the team, all members will be required to complete their
                    individual tasks before the deadline set by the team. The cognitions acquired by each team member is
                    exchanged amongst other fellow members of the team so that everyone is on the same page. These are the
                    set of covenants that we have agreed upon.

                    Our main audience would be all middle school to college level students, who have access to cell phones,
                    social media or computers. We feel they are the most susceptible to the effects of social media, and most
                    likely have trouble with schedules and remembering deadlines. Although we are targeting students, this app
                    can also be useful to business owners, employees, and basically anyone that needs to block out distractions
                    from their lives for a period of time, so they can focus on their task. By constantly researching, observing
                    users, and collecting feedback from conducted surveys, we hope to gain a better understanding about some
                    of the problems users face with social media distractions, and scheduling. These, in turn, would allow
                    the team to use the problems in improving on the design, so as to adequately match the needs of the users.
                    After gathering information to develop a working prototype, a task walk-through will be conducted at
                    several stages of the design, firstly to measure the intuitive look and feel of the user interface and
                    then the actual functionality. We believe that by observing users at various design stages, we can get
                    firsthand insight about how well they respond to the design. We will need assistance from school institutions
                    that have course scheduling websites (like RIT’s myCourses), to help provide the adequate security clearance
                    (at the students’ request), so that access can be granted for synchronization of the class schedule onto
                    the application.

                        Hi, my name is Abhishek Suhas Mhatre, I was wondering if you could please spare a moment of your
                        time for a quick interview.
                        My team and I are developing a prototype for an app that uses the pomodoro technique. Are you
                        familiar with the pomodoro technique? If no (it’s a time management technique that uses a TIMER
                        to break down work into 25 minutes interval, separated by short breaks).
                        We would be extending this technique by adding a social media-blocking feature, to help people
                        that easily get distracted by social media, concentrate when they need to study, or in a meeting,
                        or even while driving.
                        </br>
                        </br>
                        We would like to talk to students/ workers and gain an understanding of how this app would be
                        useful to them.
                        We would like to audio record this session if you don’t mind, but if in anytime during the interview,
                        you don’t feel comfortable, feel free to let me know and we would cancel the recording. I am providing
                        an website link of my app which will give you a overall idea as well - https://avsiid.wordpress.com

                        </br>
                        </br>
                        Hi, my name is Abhishek Suhas Mhatre, I was wondering if you could please spare a moment of your
                        time for a quick interview.
                        My team and I are developing a prototype for an app that uses the pomodoro technique. Are you
                        familiar with the pomodoro technique? If no (it’s a time management technique that uses a TIMER
                        to break down work into 25 minutes interval, separated by short breaks).
                        We would be extending this technique by adding a social media-blocking feature, to help people
                        that easily get distracted by social media, concentrate when they need to study, or in a meeting,
                        or even while driving.
                        </br>
                        </br>
                        We would like to talk to students/ workers and gain an understanding of how this app would be
                        useful to them.
                        We would like to audio record this session if you don’t mind, but if in anytime during the interview,
                        you don’t feel comfortable, feel free to let me know and we would cancel the recording.
