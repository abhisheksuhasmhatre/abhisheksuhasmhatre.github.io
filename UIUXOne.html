                        As observed there are many drivers who face parking problems when they are in a hurry. So
                        I tried to chalk out a initial plan to do a user research on the drivers in my college.
                        The first step was to do a qualitiative analysis on the drivers in the parking lot by just observing their
                        behavior. The second step was to take interviews with the drivers while they drive and ask them appropriate
                        questions. As we got the problem scenarios we designed the personae (profiles) of the participants.
                        The forth step was to create a story board and scenarios.

                        <b>Observation: -</b> In all 96 cars were observed. Out of which 56 drivers parked their cars and 40 left
                        the parking lot. On an average driver took approximately 50 seconds to 1.5minutes to park their car,
                        this time depended on how the driver approached the parking space. Drivers arrive in 3 to 4 minutes of
                        time intervals. It can be a case that it might be a start of lecture, which caused an initial rush.
                        Drivers were mostly students, a few college staff and professors. It was a cold day so everybody had
                        his or her sweaters on. The ratio was 65 males to 31 females. Female drivers took 40% more time to park
                        that to males. Students who were to attend lectures parked their cars near to row 1 in the parking lot,
                        where as the staff preferred parking spaces after 3rd row. Almost all the cars entered or exited the parking
                        lot from gate number 2, which is on the right hand side of the image shown on the first page. Drivers
                        were aged between 20-50 approximately. Some observations that led to some research questions and interview
                        questions were, some drivers found it hard to find a parking space as some cars were categorized in
                        SUV that are big heavy duty vehicles which obstructed their sight to recognize a available parking
                        space behind it. The initial rush to the parking lot made me curious to ask some interview questions
                        regarding the selection of the parking lot and the parking space that they choose. As per observations
                        too many cars were parked in S parking lot and too many left as well, how convenient was it for the
                        drivers to find a space and if not what measures can be taken to reduce the problem to minimal. One
                        very odd observation made was not all people parked their cars in the same fashion. Some parked their
                        cars towards the end line of the car park and some parked away from it, i.e. either the cars tail faced
                        the end yellow line or the cars head faced the end yellow line. Which made me a bit curious to ask this
                        observation as an interview question to the person to be interviewed. One possible answer that came
                        to my mind was maybe some people are well organized and because some people don’t like to go reverse
                        while leaving the lot and it makes them easy to leave rather then wasting time to reverse the car and
                        then turn to desired direction.

                        <b>Research Question and Interview Questions: - </b>  From the initial observations, several
                        possible research questions arise.  A basic question would simply be: “How convenient is parking at RIT?”
                        This might result in a variety of qualitative answers, but these answers would likely be different depending
                        upon the particular parking lot in question and the time of day being considered.  Note that different
                        group members performed observations for this study independently and different lots were observed at
                        different times.  While the data recorded suggests that access to parking in Lot J between 8:15 and
                        9:15 on a Thursday was fairly easy, the data recorded for Lot E is quite different, indicating that
                        very few spaces were available there during the 4:00 to 5:00 interval.  Therefore, a more specific
                        research question might be more helpful, such as: “What improvements could be made to the RIT parking
                        system to make parking more convenient?” or even better: “Does driver usage of RIT parking lots suggest
                        ways that the parking system could be improved?”  This last question lends itself to data collection
                        and further study, since it targets an observable phenomenon – the behavior of drivers who use the RIT
                        parking lots.  The goal of this research is to learn whether the observed behavior can be used to identify
                        problems with the current system, and if so, whether any improvements suggest themselves.

                        </br>
                        Focusing on this question, therefore, the following interview questions were developed:</br>

                        <b>Interview: -</b>
                        The interview was conducted with a fellow friend of mine named Madhusudan Hanagal.
                        He is a student in Computer Science department in Golisano building. The time of the interview was
                        recorded was 7:38PM Tuesday on November 3rd 2015, at ‘The Province’ after the parking lot incident.
                        </br>
                        </br>
                        The interview started with general questions regarding his name, college information for documentation
                        purposes. The first question popped up was which car does he drive. As he is fascinated with Dodge,
                        he drives a Dodge, which he owns. A general discussion over his car went on for few minutes and some
                        comparisons of that car with others. Coming back to the topic he was asked about the selection of the
                        parking lot. Since the most of the questions were option constrained he choose the first option ‘A’.
                        The reason he chooses that parking spot be because it was the closest spot available near to the building.
                        As per the option ‘A’ he choose. The next question that popped up was how long does it take to find a
                        parking space. His answer varied, not all days have same amount of traffic and as he up-downs college
                        everyday as per his calculations it takes him around 1-2 minutes to find a parking space, depending
                        upon the cars parked. At some occasions it has taken him more then 2 minutes to find a parking space,
                        which cost him a lecture as well. There was a short discussion over the lecture issue as well.
                        </br>
                        </br>
                        The next question I asked him was how long did it take for him to reach his destination from his
                        vehicle. From the place he parks his vehicle, it is not always that he parks it in the first row
                        or second. But the least amount of time taken for him to reach his destination is 5 minutes and
                        at times he needed 6 to 7 minutes to reach his destination, as he parked cars in different rows at different times.
                        </br>
                        </br>
                        He usually arrives to the destination on time. As per my observations, I shoot out one question
                        regarding the way he parks his car. He is usually a well-organized person, so my guess was right
                        regarding the way some people park their cars. He does not like to go reverse while leaving the
                        lot and it makes him easier to leave rather then wasting time to reverse the car and then turn
                        to other direction. I was amused with the similarity with his thoughts and mine, because I also
                        like to do the same while parking my car in the parking lot.
                        </br>
                        </br>
                        The other obvious question was when would he park in a different parking lot. He chooses the
                        option ‘D’.  One question I asked him to rate between 1 to 7 how likely was it that he cannot
                        find a spot in the parking lot, to which he choose number 2. The other question I asked him related
                        to the pervious one was whether he would change his parking lot in the next semester. To which he
                        choose number 1. Where 1 was not at all likely and 7 was extremely likely. I popped up a question
                        how likely was it that he could park his vehicle in a reserved lot and not in general lot in a
                        parking space, to which he answered was he would not like to get into a fine from the security
                        and would not like to do that in any case but if in case of an emergency he would do it, and give
                        a valid explanation to such an act.
                        </br>
                        </br>
                        The problem I observed with different people in the parking lot was they couldn’t see parking
                        spaces at times. I asked him the same question, to which at times he faces this situations when
                        there are too many cars parked or if bigger cars are parked in front or side of the parking space
                        it is difficult for one to see that space. The last question I asked him was whether he would like
                        to comment anything on the current parking situations in college, he was a bit disappointed to
                        the situation or the problems fellow drivers encounter with in daily life and wanted this problem
                        to be solved. The duration of the interview was 20 minutes and 17 seconds.
                        The problems I observed during my observations in the parking lot were absolutely true, I came
                        to this conclusion as I interviewed my friend. The answers are the evidence. Where he faces similar
                        problems like other people that I observed in the parking lot. Problems regarding difficulty to
                        find free spaces in a perking lot, wasting time to find a space in a densely filled parking lot,
                        difficulty to see for a parking space, which is hidden behind a big car. I gave him two solutions
                        for these problems, first one was to use green and red light LEDs as signs, where green would
                        suggest a free space and a red otherwise and second to use a LCD display to give total number of
                        free spaces in the parking lot. He liked the solution on the current problem. The observations
                        led me to ask certain obvious questions to the interviewed person and the assumptions made during
                        the observation were proved true as per answers given.

                        <b>Visitor Setting:</b> RIT Parking Lot J
                        </br>
                        I’m visiting RIT today to meet my husband after his class in Golisano Hall at 11:00. I’m driving my
                        2011 Toyota Corolla, and the weather is clear and cool. I enter the RIT campus at the main entrance
                        from Jefferson Road; turn right before the roundabout, then left on Reynolds Drive. I would like to
                        park as close as possible to Golisano Hall, in Lot J. There are four entrances to the main part of
                        the lot from this road, but I know that the two closest sections of the lot are for “Reserved” permits
                        only, and I have my husband’s General permit, so I have to choose one of the two northernmost entrances.
                        The lot looks to be at least half full, and of course the closest sections fill up first. I can’t see
                        clearly if there are any available spaces, but I have about ten minutes to spare before meeting my
                        husband, so I’ll take a chance and choose the closer entrance. As I turn right into the lot and head
                        west, I see two cars heading toward me from the other side of the lot – maybe one of them has just
                        left an open spot. I continue down the row, but don’t find any open spaces in the eastern half of
                        the lot. I pause at the central crosswalk to yield to a couple of pedestrians. I continue through
                        the lot and reach the western side without finding any open spaces. Those other drivers must have
                        been looking for parking too. I turn right and then right again to head back east down the next row.
                        I see some open spaces, but I want to go as close as I can to the central crosswalk so I pass a few
                        spaces – it’s hard to see if there are any closer ones, so I pick one about eight spaces from the
                        crosswalk, on the left side. I use my turn signal and slow down, and then carefully turn left into
                        the space, and then put the car in park. I turn off the car, get out, then close and lock the door
                        behind me. From here it will take me about ten minutes to walk to the building, and since it took me
                        an extra minute or so to find an available space, I might be a few minutes late to meet my husband.
                        I’ll text him to let him know.

                        </br>
                        I’m driving to RIT today for my 9:30 class in Brown Hall. It’s cool and rainy today, so I hope I don’t
                        have to walk too far in the rain. I’m driving my 2013 Volkswagen Polo, and I have my “Reserved” permit
                        to allow me to park in the closest spaces to the buildings. The lot is very popular and the closest
                        spaces are often full, so as I enter from Tyler Drive on the west side, I look up to consult the
                        LotMonitor at the entrance. The LotMonitor consists of a 8 x 8 foot square display monitor mounted
                        on a pole at the west side of Lot S, and at the top it displays in large bright green text: “Available
                        Spaces: 200 of 622”. Beneath that, there is a graphical representation of Lot S, with all the occupied
                        spaces indicated with a red ‘O’ and all vacant spaces indicated with a green ‘V’. Handicapped spaces
                        are outlined with a blue rectangle and reserved spaces are outlined with a yellow diamond shape. The
                        colors are a quick indication for those with typical vision, while the letters provide the necessary
                        information for colorblind drivers. The building is on the east side of the lot, and I can see that
                        all of the closest spaces in the second and third rows are filled, but the fourth row has several open
                        spaces fairly close to the east side of the lot, so I turn right at the fourth row and drive toward
                        the building. I see one car heading east in front of me in the same row, and the driver parks in a
                        free spot on the left. I saw on the display that there were still two more available spots on the
                        right side of the row further east, so I continue driving, and I find the open spaces, as expected.
                        I use my turn signal and pull into a space. I know that the LotMonitor’s sensors in the parking lot
                        will detect my car and change this space from a white rectangle to a Red signal to indicate to later
                        arrivals that this space is no longer available. The number of available spaces will also be decremented
                        as necessary. I get out, lock the car, and head to my 9:30 class; it looks like I’ll be five minutes early.
