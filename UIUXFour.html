                            My team did a usability testing on a company's application to find out usability issues in the
                            application. After the heuristic evaluation we conducted a study with participants to find the
                            problems and get to solutions.

                        The Sigma Client Windows Application allows communication between n-number of users via via chat,

                        voice and video calls. This application uses two types of accounts, XMPP for chat and SIP for voice/video.

                        In order to gain more knowledge on how to improve the user’s experience while communicating using

                        Sigma Client application, the REDCOM team wanted usability students at Rochester Institute of

                        Technology to conduct Heuristic Evaluation and run Usability Test on their application. Our primary goal

                        is to identify areas in which users may encounter problems while completing basic tasks on the

                        Sigma Client application.

                        This report includes our findings and proposes some improvements to the interface of the application that

                        will further encourage users to prefer using this applications without having any difficulty.

                        The two major usability problem in this application that were discovered by our team fall under following

                        heuristic: Group like widgets/function and External Consistency.

                        Our team has recommended certain alterations to fix the design problems in order to clarify the use of the

                        widgets and provide user with better experience.

                        <b>1.External Consistency</b></br></br>

                        <b>Definition:</b> The system uses interactions and design patterns that are consistent with the platform and
                        analogous systems.</br></br>

                        <b>General Impression:</b> Most interactions are externally consistent. The application does not
                        have a “Call” functionality in the dial window.</br>

                        <b>Issue Description:</b> The phone application for dialing numbers in smartphones and in other
                        VOIP applications usually have a call start and call end button. This feature is not there in the Sigma
                        application.</br>

                        <b>Possible Cause:</b> The users have to change their behavior and will be forced to search for the call
                        function.</br>

                        Suggestion Fix: A call start and call end button feature can embedded in the application.</br></br>

                        <b>2. Widgets and labels near widgets</b></br></br>

                        <b>Definition:</b> Place widgets (controls) adjacent to their respective targets of operation and labels on, or
                        directly adjacent to, their associated controls. General Impression: Items that the drop down
                        from the menu bar should be labelled correctly. The redundant arrows for expansion can confuse
                        the end user and thus should be eliminated from the list. The label and icons should be externally
                        consistent.</br></br>

                        <b>Issue Description:</b></br>

                        2.1. The call history and contact list icons are overlapping and are placed in the peripheral vision.
                        The functions may not be mapped correctly and will not be perceived by the user.</br>

                        2.2. Icons are repeated for Account
                        Information and Contact Information under Tools dropdown.</br>

                        2.3. Call forwarding does not have a dropdown as suggested by the forward triangle icon.
                        Call start and call end button can be added Overlapping - call history & contact list icons
                        No drop-down as suggested by the arrow and Repeated icons contact list call history.</br>

                        2.4. The blue bar under the Audio tab in Options menu does not have applicable labels to the
                        widgets.</br>

                        <b>Problem cause:</b> Many labels are not named correctly or do not have any indication at all.</br>

                        <b>Suggestion Fix:</b> Labels should be named with their appropriate labels adjacent to the widgets

                        We plan on collecting Quantitative Data like:</br></br>

                        1. How much time does it take for the participants to make a call to another user?</br>
                        2. Are participants able to adjust the audio settings in the application to improve their sound
                        quality for voice communication?</br>
                        3. How easily can the participants change the wrong number or a wrongly spelled contact after
                        typing it in the search bar?</br>
                        4. What obstacles do the participants face when trying to save a contact to a speed dial button?</br>
                        5. How difficult is it to find and create a conference call?</br>
                        6. Can participants find a way to hide the speed dial buttons on the screen?</br>
                        7. How long does it take for the participants to find their call history?</br>
                        8. Can participants test if their audio out and notification sounds are working?</br>
                        9. Are participants able to check the input level of the microphone on the screen?</br>
                        10. Can participants use the call-forwarding feature in the application?</br>
                        11. How long and how much iteration does users take to get a clear video without lag during a video call?</br>
                        12. How many users in the call (apart from the user who has added the new user) are able to figure
                        out immediately if another user has joined the conference call?</br>
                        13. How long does it take for users to realize if they have selected correct option (XMPP/SIP) while
                        adding a contact to the list?</br></br>

                        We also plan on collecting Qualitative Data like:</br></br>

                        14. Participants will think aloud along the task and will need to explain if they get confused
                        or stuck on a certain task.</br>
                        15. Are participants comfortable not having a save button in the options menu after they have
                        changed a few settings? How many times do participants feel the need for a save button in the option menu?</br>
                        16. Do users feel that the call history log is too technical and difficult to understand?
                        In one-to-one communication, can a user identify if another user has joined the call or left it?
                        (join and left actions have similar tones)?</br>
                        17. Do users want shortcut keys? If so, what functions do they want the shortcut keys for?</br>
                        18. Will participants be able to understand the buttons on the screen during a call?</br>
                        19. What do the users think about the hold tone?</br>
                        20. There will be a post test questionnaire conducted, to understand how the participants felt
                        about using the application and to get additional information about the application.</br>
                        21. Do participants require any additional features or options?</br>
                        22. What does the participant think about the user interface and design of the application?</br>
                        23. What other applications do users find this application similar to? And how well does it
                        compare with these other applications?
